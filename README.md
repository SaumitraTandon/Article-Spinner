# Article Spinning and Classification

This project demonstrates text processing and classification using the `bbc_text_cls.csv` dataset, which contains news articles categorized into various topics. The main objective is to explore the dataset, preprocess the text data, and apply techniques such as tokenization and detokenization, using Python libraries like `nltk` and `pandas`.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project is `bbc_text_cls.csv`, which contains 2,225 news articles labeled with the following categories:

- **business**
- **entertainment**
- **politics**
- **sport**
- **tech**

### Dataset Structure

The dataset consists of two columns:

- **text**: Contains the full text of the news articles.
- **labels**: The category or label associated with each article.

Example rows from the dataset:

| text                                                                 | labels      |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Ad sales boost Time Warner profit...                                 | business    |
| Dollar gains on Greenspan speech...                                  | business    |
| Yukos unit buyer faces loan claim...                                 | business    |
| High fuel prices hit BA's profits...                                 | business    |
| Pernod takeover talk lifts Domecq...                                 | business    |

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main components:

### 1. Data Loading and Exploration

- The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for exploration.
- Basic statistics and the unique set of labels are extracted to understand the distribution of articles across different categories.

### 2. Text Processing

- **Tokenization**: The `nltk` library is used to tokenize the text data into words. This is essential for performing further text operations such as stemming or lemmatization (if needed).
- **Detokenization**: After performing operations on tokens, the words are rejoined into full sentences using `TreebankWordDetokenizer` from `nltk`.

### 3. Libraries and Dependencies

The following Python libraries are used in this project:

- `numpy`: For numerical computations.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `nltk`: For natural language processing tasks such as tokenization.

Make sure you have these installed before running the notebook. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas nltk
```

### 4. Running the Project

To run the project:

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Ensure the dataset (`bbc_text_cls.csv`) is in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook (`Article_Spinning.ipynb`) and run the cells sequentially.

### 5. Future Improvements

- **Text Classification**: Implement machine learning models to classify the articles based on their content.
- **Advanced Text Processing**: Consider adding stemming, lemmatization, and stopword removal for enhanced text preprocessing.
- **Data Visualization**: Explore the data further by visualizing the distribution of articles across different categories.
